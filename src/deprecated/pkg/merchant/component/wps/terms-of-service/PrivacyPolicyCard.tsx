              learn about your online activity including on other sites or
              services. For example, web beacons allow ad networks to provide
              aggregated auditing, research and reporting for us and for
              advertisers. Web beacons also enable ad networks to serve targeted
              advertisements to you when you visit other websites. Because your
              web browser must request these advertisements and web beacons from
              the ad network's servers, these companies can view, edit, or set
              their own cookies, just as if you had requested a web page from
              their site.

              We do not have access to Cookies placed or read by Advertisers,

              If you would like to exercise any of your California consumer
              rights, please submit a request at wps-privacy@wish.com. You will
              be required to verify your identity before we fulfill your
              request. To do so, you will typically need to demonstrate control
              of the relevant account and show California residence. You can
              also designate an authorized agent to make a request on your
              behalf. To do so, you must provide us with written authorization
              or a power of attorney, signed by you, for the agent to act on
              your behalf. You will still need to verify your identity directly
              with us.

              If you are a California resident, you may ask for a list of third
              parties that have received your information for direct marketing

              contains the types of information shared. We provide this list at
              no cost. To make such a request, contact us at
              wps-privacy@wish.com.
